#Bezier 

This assignment has been made as a part of the Computer Graphics course that I took in my bachelor's degree in computer science at Ben-Gurion University. This assignment was made with OpenGL and C++.

In this assignment, we have created a 3D shape with cylindrical symmetry (for your 3D environment), by manipulating the 1D Bezier curve.

The feature set that was implemented in this assignment is as follows:
* Create a curve according to the Bezier equation.
* Rotation of one object around another object.
* Align a few objects in one line with math operations.
* Movement of objects included movement as a group, and movement of a 3D object around is center
* Created a 3D shape with cylindrical symmetry (for your 3D environment), by manipulating the 1D Bezier curve.
* Detection if pressing was in Convex hull
* Creation of a cube map world
* Scissor test
* Stencil test
* Projection, View, and Model matrixes
